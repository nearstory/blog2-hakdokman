I know travelers want to have something special when they travel other countries. Indeed, it's really easy to buy expensive foods when you go out of your country. If you agree with me, it's a nice choice to go to Texas de Brazil, which is located on  both **Apgujeong-dong** and **Seoul Express Bus Terminal**.

Anyway, what I wanna say is, Texas de Brazil is a steak house. It's very professionally dealing with Churrasco. I forget to say it. Y'all **must reserve** this restaurant a day before. Here is really popular now, you can reserve here by phone call and "Naver reservation". If you're a foreigner, okay then, I strongly recommend that you use your phone call. When you enter the door of Texas de Brazil of Apgujeong-dong,

Yes, do you feel the mood of Brazil? No? All right.

You can use salad bar before preparing grilled beef. I convince to say, you don't have time to use after you get start to eat various beef steaks. It's unlimited unless you turn a coin upside down. On your table, there is the coin. The coin has different colors such as red and green on each side. If you need more, you put it on green side. You don't want to have for a time, then you need to put it on red side.
