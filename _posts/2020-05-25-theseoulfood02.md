# My review

   I really love jjigae, which means Korean style stew. Like before I said, this kind of stew has lots of sausage, meat with gochujang sauce (It is spicy, a bit of sweet sauce. Gochujang is Korean style of chili-pepper paste.)

 It’s reasonable price many people who visited here said. I agree with them, because they serve large quantity of food with good quality for one portion. If you’re a stew lover with rice, I can say, this place is very nice choice to choose your one meal in Korea.

 Especially, It is well-known as a combo set, which consist of 2 servings of special budae-jjigae and a half of Korean style donkatsu(Pork cutlet). If your group has a heavy eater, it is a good try to order that menu.
