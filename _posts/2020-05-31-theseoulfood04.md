If you prefer to satisfy with quantity of meat rather than quality of meat, you should feel good what I'm about to introduce now. It will be a good recommendation if you live near this restaurant.

# My review

![samsamine banchan](/img/posts/04/04.png)

This is a basic ban-chan (It is a Korean style side dish.) Blanched Garlic chives, Blanched bean sprouts, Kimchi, Ssamjang (It is a sauce which is mixed with soy bean paste and chili paste.), Garlic, Sliced chili peppers. This Korean Barbecue restaurant is famous for reasonable price and quantity. So, many students have visited here continuously, I'm one of them, too. Of course I'm not a student anymore now.. sob sob.

Let's get start to grill samgyeopsal!(In English, it is a pork belly.) But sorry to say it, a old manager will take all stuff instead of you. You don't have any opportunity to grill meats.

Anyway, you should forget to order stir-fried rice before you leave this place. After you finished your meal, you must have it. It is an usual Korean food culture to finish with stir-fried rice when you eat Korean Barbecue. Most of Korean Barbecue restaurant have this service.
