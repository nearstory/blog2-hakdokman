**Caution !!!**

This place is sooooo popular, then you have to wait here before it opens. Time to open is 17:00, however you should be arrived at 16:00 because reservation for here starts at 16:00. There is no way to reserve in online. You can receive a text message when your turn comes.

**There are at least 5-10 teams in waiting line in an average even though you are late for a little.** Here is really popular, as I said.

It's different that its Hangjeong-sal is more chewy and juicy than other Korean barbecue restaurants. Insane & unreal flavor.

It's a basic ban-chan of this place. You are able to enjoy meats with various sauces you want. Tasty of so many Kimchi gives you more fun.
