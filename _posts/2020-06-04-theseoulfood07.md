At the first post I wrote, Budae-jjigae was from supplies of U.S. Army at Korean war. What I need to mention is that still U.S. Army is located near Uijeongbu city, which is the home town of Budae-jjiage. Budae-jjigae has transformed a lot while South Korea has been developed, but originally, Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae consists of lots of vegetables, especially Buttercup. Buttercup gives special synergy when you eat a bit of salty ingredients.



 This place is so popular, you should go at open time(17:00). No reservation by online. Then, you might think that you have to wait in a line. But, there is a way to reserve this place. It opens reservation at 16:00 in front of the restaurant. 

Caution !!!

This place is sooooo popular, then you have to wait here before it opens. Time to open is 17:00, however you should be arrived at 16:00 because reservation for here starts at 16:00. There is no way to reserve in online. You can receive a text message when your turn comes.

**There are at least 5-10 teams in waiting line in an average even though you are late for a little.** Here is really popular, as I said.

It's different that its Hangjeong-sal is more chewy and juicy than other Korean barbecue restaurants. Insane & unreal flavor.

It's a basic ban-chan of this place. You are able to enjoy meats with various sauces you want. Tasty of so many Kimchi gives you more fun.
