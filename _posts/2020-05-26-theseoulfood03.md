# My review

   I really love Dak-galbi, too. It's usually called spicy stir fried chicken for foreigners.

 It’s also reasonable price considering other Dak-galbi restaurant. But you should know that you need to add something like extra noodles, ramen, or cheese. After ordering additional ingredients, you got a feel you did a good job. It's probably needless to talk more about it. Comparing to other Dak-galbi such as famous franchised Dak-galbi restaurant well-known by foreigners, its Dak-galbi is not much salt and spciy. It's really proper.
