# Easy to fail finding restaurant in Korea? 



**What I would do?**

  I’ve lived in Seoul for 30 years. Even though I’ve seen lots of foreign travelers & workers in Seoul, I think that there is a few information about foods. I’ll give them more enjoyable tips to prevent them from failure. (I chose menus which most of you guys would love and enjoy.)

1. **Korean Barbecue**

   Korean barbecue refers to the popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling meat, typically beef, pork, or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining table itself.

2. **Budae-jjigae (Army Stew, spicy sausage stew)**

   Budae-jjigae or spicy sausage stew is a type of jjigae, made with ham, sausage, spam, baked beans, kimchi and gochujang. The dish was created shortly after the armistice that ended the Korean War, using the scrounged or smuggled surplus foods from the U. S. army bases.

3. **Dak-galbi (Spicy stir-fried chicken)**

   Dak-galbi, or spicy stir-fried chicken, is a popular Korean dish made by stir-frying marinated diced chicken in a gochujang-based sauce with sweet potatoes, cabbage, perilla leaves, scallions, tteok, and other ingredients. In Korean, galbi means rib. But Dak-galbi is not actually chicken's rib.
