description: "Classic Budae-jjigae with green vegetables"

At the first post I wrote, Budae-jjigae was from supplies of U.S. Army at Korean war. What I need to mention is that still U.S. Army is located near Uijeongbu city, which is the home town of Budae-jjiage. Budae-jjigae has transformed a lot while South Korea has been developed, but originally, Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae consists of lots of vegetables, especially Buttercup. Buttercup gives special synergy when you eat a bit of salty ingredients.

Anyway, this restaurant is considered classic Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae I think, let me introduce its food with photos.

**P.S. There are lots of names of a Budae-jjigae restaurant with "Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae" in Korea.** Here is a just nice one of them.

You did read my second post? There are a bit of difference even though both foods are same menu. Because former one is **'Johnson style'**, and what I introduce now is Original **'Uijeongbu style'**. Johnson style of Budae-jjigae has many sausages & ham with cheesy soup. More greasy with a full of flavor. Normally, younger people prefer to have it.
